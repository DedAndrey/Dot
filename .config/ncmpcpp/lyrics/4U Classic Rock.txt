I just crashed and got some classic whiplash
I take a look up out the window, and I see this red flash
Cannot believe all this-all this shit that′s right in front of meI can't deceive all the-all the people listen to me breathe

I′m fuckin' feat, fo the hell I went through laying six feet deep
I'm done with heat, I just pull up smashin′ in all of your teeth
I′mma violent piece of shit, you want some smoke I got you, bitch
I'm runnin′ out I got no clips, but that's ok I got my fists

Thinkin′-Thinkin' that you′re broke, but I'm gonna rob you anyway
Get a nice hook to the face, step outta my way
Freddie is the master and your pussy in my palms
I'mma mow you like the lawn
Bitch is suckin′ on my john
Freddie′s classic bang along, as I scream out to the crowd
What the fuck you want some more, Imma give a killer encore
Call me the conductor I'mma play you like some notes
Fuck what you gotta know, Freddie ′bout to fuckin' blow

Beat you-Beat you with a rock, so simple, no need for a Glock
Break you with the stick, bleedin′ bitch
Come and fuck with this
Murder is my speciality, I use anything
Slit your throat and make you choke, we can barely reign
Beat you with a rock, so simple, no need for a Glock
Break you with the stick, bleedin' bitch
Come and fuck with this
Murder is my speciality, I use anything
Slit your throat and make you choke, we can barely-Beat- beat

Beat you with the a rock, so simple, no need for a Glock
Break you with the stick, bleedin′ bitch
Come and fuck with this
Murder is my speciality, I use anything
Slit your throat and make you choke, we can barely reign
Beat you with a rock, so simple, no need for a Glock
Break you with the stick, bleedin' bitch
Come and fuck with this
Murder is my speciality, I use anything
Slit your throat and make you choke-
